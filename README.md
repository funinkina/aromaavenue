# [AROMA AVENUE](https://funinkina.github.io/aromaavenue/)
### A mockup website for the perfume brand Aroma Avenue.

The design follows newbrutalism to some extent. The color pallete I choose for this website, the pale purple color `#B899A8`, feels truly like a sweet thing. And a dark gray `rgb(60, 60, 60)` to compliment it. I kept the design pretty simple by only using CSS and keeping the whole page minimialistic.

The font for the logo is called **Bebas Neue**. The bold and all capitalized font gives the brand a *Stylish* and *Modern era* vibe.

The webpage is also responsive hence works seamlessly on both desktops and smartphones and even tablets!

All the mockups of the perfume bottles are created using _Adobe Photoshop_.
